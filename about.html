      Although travel agencies do represent an important distribution channel for companies in the travel and tourism sector, especially for attracting incremental bookings, it is important to understand that your own website should always be regarded as the number one distribution channel and the reasons for this are numerous.
      Firstly, bookings that are made through your own website will not require you to pay a commission in the same way that you would with a booking facilitated by a travel agency. This means you will be able to keep all of the money that customers spend. It also means you can own the customer journey from start to finish, enhancing your options for communication and providing you with additional opportunities for up-selling and cross-selling.<br>
